  Our fellow gift-giver!\
  </p>\
  <p>\
  The important and special holiday for all of us is coming very soon \u2014 New Year! \
  On the eve of this day, we want to create a festive atmosphere in the office, please our colleagues and get a good mood.\
  </p>\
  <p>\
  We invite you to take part in the kind and intriguing game \
  <b>\u00ABSecret Santa\u00BB.</b>\
  </p>\
  <p>\
  The idea of the game is very simple: in the company, each employee gets a \u00ABgiftee\u00BB, \
  who needs to come up with a small present, while the gift-giver remains incognito as a \
  \u00ABSecret Santa\u00BB. The name of the person you are giving a gift to \
  is chosen randomly on the draw, and only you know about it.\
  </p>\
  <p>\
  Terms and conditions of the game:\
  </p>\
  <ul>\
  <li>You need to register and fill out your profile by <b>December %DAY%.</b></li>\
  <li><b>On December %DAY%</b>, an online draw will be held, after which each participant will have their own Secret Santa.</li>\
  <li>The present should be placed under the Christmas tree in the common hall before December %DAY%. \
  <b>Please label</b> the present with the recipient's name!</li>\
  <li>The presenting ceremony will take place on December %DAY%, during the festive buffet.</li>\
  <li>The estimated cost of the present is at least $$.</li>\
  </ul>\
  <p>\
  We hope that it will be interesting for you to participate in the game. \
  After all, it is pleasant not only to receive gifts, but also to give ones!\
  </p>\
  <p>\
  Happy New Year to all of you!\
  </p>\
